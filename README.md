CONGREGATE: Contrastive Graph Clustering in Curvature Space.

i) In this paper, we are the FIRST to introduce a novel curvature space, supporting fine-grained curvature modeling, to graph clustering.

ii) We compare with 19 state-of-the-art baselines in total. The baselines are introduced in the Technical Appendix, and all the baselines are implemented according to the original papers. 

iii) We give a sample implementation of CONGREGATE in this appendix.

iv) Implement CONGREGATE
Our model consists of M restricted manifolds and 1 free manifold.
The number of M, and the dimension of manifolds need to be configured for an specific instantiation. (Note that, the restricted manifolds have learnable curvatures, which is another novelty of our model.)
Also, the weighting coefficient alpha's are the hyperparameters of the loss function.

The requirements is listed below.
	a) 	Python 3.7
	b)		Pytorch >= 1.1
	c)		numpy
	d)		scikit-learn
	e)		networkx


v) We will release all the source code of our project HCS_GC, heterogeneous curvature space-graph clustering after publication. 

vi) We evaluate our model on 4 benchmark datasets, and all the datasets are publicly available. Please refer to the following papers for further details on the datasets.
